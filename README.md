```
3. The server will start on localhost port 8000 by default


### Connecting to Claude Desktop

For detailed instructions on setting up the MCP server with Claude Desktop, see [CLAUDE_DESKTOP_SETUP.md](CLAUDE_DESKTOP_SETUP.md).

Quick setup:
1. Open Claude Desktop
2. Go to Settings -> Developer
3. Click "Edit Config"
4. Add the configuration for the NEU Calendar MCP server
5. Restart Claude Desktop

### Using the Extension

Once the extension is installed and the server is running, you can ask Claude about Northeastern University events. For example:

- "What events are happening today at Northeastern University?"
- "Show me upcoming events for the next week"
- "Are there any workshops happening this month?"
- "Tell me about athletic events at Northeastern"
- "What categories of events are available?"

## Troubleshooting

- If Claude can't connect to the server, make sure the server is running and that the port (8000) is not blocked by a firewall
- If the server can't fetch the calendar data, check your internet connection
- If Claude Desktop reports an extension configuration error, verify that the configuration is correct
- See [CLAUDE_DESKTOP_SETUP.md](CLAUDE_DESKTOP_SETUP.md) for detailed troubleshooting steps
